# File-upload related topics in PHP

Let's go through each step more comprehensively for the file upload example:

### 1\. File Uploads using `$_FILES`:

#### HTML Form (index.html):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>File Upload Form</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form action="upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <label for="userfile">Choose a file:</label>
        <input type="file" name="userfile" id="userfile">
        <input type="submit" value="Upload">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

#### PHP File Upload Script (upload.php):

```php
<?php
$target_dir = "uploads/";
$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["userfile"]["name"]);
$uploadOk = 1;

// Check if file already exists
if (file_exists($target_file)) {
    echo "Sorry, the file already exists.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}

// Check file size
if ($_FILES["userfile"]["size"] > 500000) { // 500 KB
    echo "Sorry, your file is too large.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}

// Allow only certain file formats
$allowed_types = array("image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/gif");
$file_type = $_FILES["userfile"]["type"];

if (!in_array($file_type, $allowed_types)) {
    echo "Invalid file type. Allowed types: " . implode(', ', $allowed_types);
    $uploadOk = 0;
}

// Check if $uploadOk is set to 0 by an error
if ($uploadOk == 0) {
    echo "Sorry, your file was not uploaded.";
} else {
    if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["userfile"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
        echo "The file ". basename($_FILES["userfile"]["name"]). " has been uploaded.";
    } else {
        echo "Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.";
    }
}
?>
```

### 2\. Handling File Upload Errors:

Include the following code snippet at the beginning of the `upload.php` script to handle file upload errors:

```php
if ($_FILES["userfile"]["error"] > 0) {
    echo "Error: " . $_FILES["userfile"]["error"];
    // Handle specific errors if needed
    // 1 - UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE: The uploaded file exceeds the upload_max_filesize directive in php.ini
    // 2 - UPLOAD_ERR_FORM_SIZE: The uploaded file exceeds the MAX_FILE_SIZE directive that was specified in the HTML form
    // 3 - UPLOAD_ERR_PARTIAL: The uploaded file was only partially uploaded
    // 4 - UPLOAD_ERR_NO_FILE: No file was uploaded
    // 6 - UPLOAD_ERR_NO_TMP_DIR: Missing a temporary folder
    // 7 - UPLOAD_ERR_CANT_WRITE: Failed to write file to disk
    // 8 - UPLOAD_ERR_EXTENSION: A PHP extension stopped the file upload
    exit;
}
```

### 3\. File Types and MIME Checking:

Include the following code snippet after checking file size in the `upload.php` script:

```php
$allowed_types = array("image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/gif");
$file_type = $_FILES["userfile"]["type"];

if (!in_array($file_type, $allowed_types)) {
    echo "Invalid file type. Allowed types: " . implode(', ', $allowed_types);
    $uploadOk = 0;
}
```

### 4\. File Size Limitations:

Include the following code snippet after checking if the file already exists in the `upload.php` script:

```php
$max_size = 500000; // 500 KB

if ($_FILES["userfile"]["size"] > $max_size) {
    echo "Sorry, your file is too large.";
    $uploadOk = 0;
}
```

### 5\. Uploading to a Specific Directory:

The example already includes code to upload files to a specific directory (`uploads/`).

### 6\. File Renaming:

Include the following code snippet after defining `$target_file` in the `upload.php` script:

```php
$new_filename = "custom_name.jpg";
$target_file = $target_dir . $new_filename;
```

### 7\. Security Considerations:

Implement additional security measures based on your application's requirements, such as validating file types, checking for malicious content, and setting appropriate permissions on upload directories.

### 8\. Multiple File Uploads:

Modify the HTML form to allow multiple file uploads:

```html
<form action="upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <label for="userfile">Choose files:</label>
    <input type="file" name="userfile[]" id="userfile" multiple>
    <input type="submit" value="Upload">
</form>
```

Modify the PHP script to handle multiple uploads:

```php
// Handle multiple uploads
foreach ($_FILES["userfile"]["error"] as $key => $error) {
    if ($error == UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {
        $tmp_name = $_FILES["userfile"]["tmp_name"][$key];
        $name = basename($_FILES["userfile"]["name"][$key]);
        move_uploaded_file($tmp_name, "uploads/" . $name);
    }
}
```

### 9\. File Downloading:

Create a download.php file with the following code:

```php
<?php
$file_path = "path/to/file.txt";

header("Content-disposition: attachment; filename=" . basename($file_path));
header("Content-type: text/plain");
readfile($file_path);
?>
```

### 10\. File Deletion:

Create a delete.php file with the following code:

```php
<?php
$file_to_delete = "path/to/file.txt";

if (file_exists($file_to_delete)) {
    unlink($file_to_delete);
    echo "File deleted successfully.";
} else {
    echo "File not found.";
}
?>
```

### 11\. File Reading and Writing:

Create a log.php file with the following code:

```php
<?php
// Writing to a file
$file_path = "path/to/log.txt";
$data_to_write = "Log entry: " . date("Y-m-d H:i:s") . "\n";

file_put_contents($file_path, $data_to_write, FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);

// Reading from a file
$file_content = file_get_contents($file_path);
echo $file_content;
?>
```

These examples cover a range of file-related operations in PHP. Make sure to customize them based on your specific needs and enhance security measures as necessary.
